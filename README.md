- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Francesca!
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in designing circuits and understanding how computers work from the core
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C++ and looking forward to merge my coding skills with my circuit projects!
- âš¡ Fun fact: Breadboards are my sketchbook and wires are my chaos.
